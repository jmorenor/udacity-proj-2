# Interactive Resume
____
##### This is the interactive resume of Paul Parson for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree project.
#####
I added custom HTML/CSS/JS to create off-canvas navigation, as well as completely redesigned the look of the resume itself.Additionally I added an icon font for some of the nav elements and contacts.
